# PISNet
We proposed a prior-induced interference suppression network (PISNet) to achieve RFI suppression and useful signal recovery in time-frequency domain. A dataset called SarTF is built to address the difficulty of data shortage to support the training of PISNet.

## SarTF Dataset
A dataset of the time-frequency spectrograms of SAR echoes with RFI, which can be used to train the end-to-end deep neural networks.

## Code
* Currently the network is suitable for dealing with interference intensity similar to that in SarTF Dataset. If the difference in the ISR (Signal-Interference-Ratio) is too large (eg. the SIR too low), the performance may be degraded. The SIR of the training set should be adjusted accordingly. 
* For specific training details, please refer to the experiment and discussion chapters of our paper.
