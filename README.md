# PISNet
We proposed a prior-induced interference suppression network (PISNet) to achieve RFI suppression and useful signal recovery in time-frequency domain. A dataset called SarTF is built to address the difficulty of data shortage to support the training of PISNet.

## SarTF Dataset
A dataset of the time-frequency spectrograms of SAR echoes with RFI, which can be used to train the end-to-end deep neural networks.
